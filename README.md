# Dynamic Programming Journey

This repository documents my journey through dynamic programming (DP), tackling the hardest problems I've always procrastinated solving.

## Goals

1. Complete the [Dynamic Programming course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)
2. Move on to [Grokking Dynamic Programming](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-a-deep-dive-using-python)
3. Apply acquired knowledge to solve LeetCode problems

## FAQ

### LeetCode

#### Dynamic Programming - Know How

- Practice as much as possible to understand the DP pattern
- [DP for Beginners: Problems, Patterns, Sample Solutions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/662866/DP-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Patterns-or-Sample-Solutions)

#### Developing Solutions: From Recurrence to Matrix

1. Start with a recursive solution
2. Identify changing parameters between calls (likely coordinates in your DP array/matrix)
3. Understand how the recursive call generates its answer from sub-calls
4. Create an equation: `currentRes = f(subRes)`
5. Find the exit case (base case) to build up from in DP

#### Key Intuitions

- Develop intuition for state variables and recurrence relationships
- [Excellent DP write-up on CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43256)

#### Approach to DP Problems

1. Find solutions for extreme values (base cases)
2. Solve recursively
3. Create recursive DP solution (Memoization)
4. Convert to iterative solution (Bottom-up approach)

Note: Choice between bottom-up and top-down depends on the problem

#### Deep Understanding

- Dissect each problem solved successfully
- Spend ample time on each problem until you have a complete understanding
- Avoid moving to new problems with only superficial understanding
